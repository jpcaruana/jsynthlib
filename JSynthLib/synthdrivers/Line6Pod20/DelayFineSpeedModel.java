/** Delay Speed is represented by three bytes in offsets 27-29. There are two
* controls in the editor, one for coarse adjustment and the other for fine
* adjustment. The range for coarse sysex values is 0-97536, where the max value
* is represented in bytes 27-29 as 0x017D00. The range for fine sysex values is 
* 0-762, where the max value is represented in bytes 27-29 as 0x0002FA. The value
* stored in offset 27-29 of the sysex record is simply the sum of the course and
* fine values. So the value with the coarse and fine values both set to maximum
* is 98298 or 0x017FFA. For the coarse control the control range of 0-127 split
* over the range 0-97536 gives steps of 768 or 0x300. The two values are 
* separated as follows:
* <br />
* <code>
*     Coarse Value = Combined Value mod 300
* <br />
*     Fine Value = Combined Value - Coarse Value
* </code>
