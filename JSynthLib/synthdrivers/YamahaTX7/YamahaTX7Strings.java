		"At this time only the direction JSynthLib->TX7 is working. If a parameter is changed on"+

		"- DEVICE EDITOR"+
		"\nGenerally I use the same labels for each parameter as the front panel display"+
		" of the TX7."+
		"\nI tried to extract the necessary information from the manual."+
		"\nBut surely this attempt wasn't successful in all parameters, since I don't own such a device."+

		"\nTo extend my driver family to the models DX1 and DX5 I'm looking for the MIDI specification of these"+
		" models. The access of the two internal \"DX7\"s as well as the complete specification of the"+
		" performance patch are unknown."+
		"\n\n"+
		"To extend my driver family to the model TX216/TX816 in a satisfying manner some major changes are"+
		" necessary for the JSynthLib architecture. But since the TF1 modul of the TX216/TX816 is compatible"+
		" with the TX7, a base support is given."+
		"\n\n"+
		"DEVICE CONFIGURATION"+

		"\nThis is a free choosable identifier. It might be useful if you have several TX7 devices"+

		"- \"Disable Memory Protection?\""+

		"\n\n"+
		"- \"Display Hints and Tips?\""+
		"\nIf you are familiar with the TX7 you can switch off the message windows by disabling"+
		" the \"Display Hints and Tips?\" function. This will avoid all messages!"+

		"Only those parameters are implemented in the editor, which are stored in the patch."+
		"\nSo, you won't find any function parameter like pitchband, portamento, etc."+
		" These are part of the performance driver/editor."+
		"\nThere is only one exception: the OPERATOR ON/OFF buttons, because they are"+
		" useful for programming."+

		" by itself. The remaining single performance patches of the bank are used by"+
		" an additional DX7 (32 voices) or DX9 (20 voices)";
