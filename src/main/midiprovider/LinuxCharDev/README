To install, place LinuxCharDev.jar into one of the Java Extension
folders (for example: /usr/lib/java/jre/lib/ext/).
And copy midiprovider/LinuxCharDev/linuxdevices.conf under the main
JSynthLib Directory and edit it to reflect your setup.
Each line in this file represents one device that you wish to have
accessible in JSynthLib.

  To build simple compile all the sources, and create a jar with the
classes and META-INF/services/javax.sound.midi.spi.MidiDeviceProvider.
Build.sh will do just this.
