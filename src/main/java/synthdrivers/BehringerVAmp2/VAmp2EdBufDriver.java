/** VAmp2 Edit Buffer Driver. Used for V-Amp 2 Edit Buffer patch.
 * Note that on the V-Amp 2, the edit buffer patch and the preset patch are
 * exactly the same format. The only difference is that for the program patch
 * the patch location is stored in byte 8 and is a value from 0 to 124 and for
 * the edit buffer patch the patch location stored in byte 8 is the value 127.
 * The only reason for having this driver is to be able to request an edit buffer
 * patch. From that point on it is handled like any other program patch.
