To install, place CAProvider.jar into one of the Java Extension
folders, preferably /Library/Java/Extensions or
~/Library/Java/Extension.

  To build simple compile all the sources, and create a jar with the
classes and META-INF/services/javax.sound.midi.spi.MidiDeviceProvider.
Build.sh will do just this. If aren't building on a Mac you'll need
CoreAudio stubs.  You can get some on the jsynthlib-dev yahoo group.
